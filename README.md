A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

## Functional Requirements:
- Admins in the system should have the following abilities:
1. View and manage user accounts, including students and instructors.
2. Review course content before it's published to ensure quality and compliance with
platform guidelines.
3. Have the authority to edit or remove courses that violate policies or are deemed
inappropriate.
4. Track platform usage by students and instructors, check the courses popularity, ratings,
reviews, ... etc.

- As an instructor, you should be able to:
1. Register and login into the system. Registration should collect information like name,
email, password, affiliation, years of experience, and bio.
2. Create courses, where each course has a name, duration, category, rating, capacity,
number of enrolled students, and list of reviews.
3. View detailed information about each course and search courses by name, category or
sort by ratings.
4. Accept/Reject student enrollments.
